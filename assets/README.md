##### Description
* Created a webpage portfolio with my photo and sections for about me, my projects and my contact information.  The webpage was to have photos of my projects with links that would direct to the deployed webpage when clicked upon.  The webpage was also to be adaptive based on the screen size.  I utilized flex boxes to accomplish this.
